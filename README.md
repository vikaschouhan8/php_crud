#DATABASE:
-- You'll need to create a database (I named mine 'records' but it can be changed) using PHPMyAdmin
-- Save the included sql file on your desktop as a .txt file
-- Once you've created the database, make sure the database is selected, then click the "import" tab
-- Select the .txt file on your desktop, and import it into your database. PHPMyAdmin will create all of the necessary tables/import some test data for you to play with
